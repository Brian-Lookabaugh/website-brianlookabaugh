### Understanding Average Effects

In the previous blog post, I mentioned that not all causal effects of treatment are the same. That is, there is no single, universal way to interpret the effect of treatment. How you should interpret the effect of treatment is determined by practical considerations within each individual research design. To take it a step further, researchers rarely are able to estimate an *individual* effect of treatment. For example, if a researcher wanted to understand the effect of foreign aid on economic development, this researcher is probably not going to estimate individual treatment (foreign aid) effects for each country (this is kind of possible, but it will be discussed later in other blog posts discussing heterogeneous treatment effects). Instead, the researcher will estimate the *average treatment* effect for countries that received treatment.

So, why can’t we just estimate individual effects? For one, it’s not exactly *scientific* in the sense that science is concerned with finding general patterns. Think about it. If a political scientist or economist is curious about the effects of foreign aid, they want to understand what drives foreign aid effectiveness generally and not in some specific country. Second, in the first blog post of this series, I mentioned “the fundamental problem of causal inference”. Recall that this refers to the fact that we don’t have time machines to observe individual units with a different treatment status (received treatment or did not receive treatment) than the one they *actually* received. If we did, we could observe individual effects pretty easily (assuming time travel ends up being easy and cheap). As of writing this blog post, we still do not have access to those time machines.

Consider a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and how many scholars consider these as the “gold standard” of scientific research. They do not resolve the time machine issue, but they are able to estimate causal effects through a different manner. Sure, they can’t treat one unit, go back in time, take away treatment, and then record the difference. What a researcher can do in this setup is randomly assign treatment to a person and randomly give another individual a placebo. Remember that randomization of treatment works out great because it eliminates confounding bias (refer back to the [first entry](https://brian-lookabaugh.github.io/website-brianlookabaugh/blog/Causal Inference/Causal Inference Blog 1/) in this series for how this works). However, if we just did this with two people (one treated person and one person given a placebo), we would have serious issues. With just two individuals, there could be all sorts of differences or similarities between these two people *in particular* that are driving the “effect” of treatment. What if we happened to accidentally randomly assign the two most different people possible to treatment and control? All sorts of things could be driving the difference in outcome between the two, independent of treatment. What if neither of these individuals featured an aspect about themselves that we *knew* was a confounding factor? For example, let’s say that gender was a confounding factor and both of these individuals are female. That would imply that, even though we are running an RCT, we know that unobserved confounding is going on and that is not good.

These issues, in practice, are largely non-existent. Why? Because we do not place that much weight on such a small group of individuals. Instead, we would randomly assign *a lot* of people to treatment and control groups. If we randomly assign a lot of people, then the differences between the groups should balance out. In the treated and control groups, we will have the wacky, average, and dull equally represented. That is good news for researchers because it creates comparable groups where, *on average*, the only difference is their exposure to treatment. The consequence, however, is that causal effects estimated from analyses such as these are *average effects*, not *individual effects*. This implies that, if you were to pick a random individual who was in the control group from a study such as this, you cannot use the average effect to estimate the difference in that *individual’s outcome* if they were to receive treatment instead. Remember, individual effects are different than average effects. Individual effects tell us about the causal effect of treatment *on that individual*, and this is a difficult task to estimate. *Average effects*, in contrast, are convenient in that they tell us about *population-level* effects for large groups of people. Given that most researcher is conducted to examine general patterns and trends, (and not *you* or any one individual in particular), this isn’t a drawback by any means.

Now that we have made it clear that effects in causal research are aggregated at the *average level*, it is important to review different type of average-level effects. The difference matters incredibly for how one might interpret an average causal effect. We are going to review four types of effects in this blog post (some of the most common), beginning with the canonical (although, difficult or impossible to estimate in many scientific fields) average effect, the **average treatment effect**.

### ATE

This is probably the easiest to understand and interpret, and its such a shame that this one is so difficult to estimate in practice. The average treatment effect (ATE) is simply the difference in average outcome between units that received treatment and those that did not receive treatment. Let’s say that treatment is a novel drug and it has an effect on outcome (such as decreasing cancer risk). We know this because the average outcome for treated units is *lower cancer risk* than control units that receive a placebo (control units). The correct interpretation of the ATE is simply that this novel drug decreases cancer risk on average in the population. Crucially, it is important to note that the assumptions required to estimate the ATE are often not supported with observational studies (studies where researchers don’t have control over who gets treatment). Estimating the ATE would imply that a researcher has estimated a causal effect that is applicable to the broader population. For this to work, a researcher needs to be sure that their treatment and control group are, on average, essentially the same. Theoretically, after executing our study, a researcher should be able to go back in time (before treatment was administered) and shuffle around who was in the treated and control group at random and still get the same results as they did in the first timeline. Because of this, estimating the ATE is popular in RCTs where researchers get to assign treatment to ensure that any effect they observe is applicable for the broader population. What if researchers do not have this ability?

### ATT and ATC

As it turns out, researchers can still do kind of the same thing as estimating the ATE, they just have to be a bit more tame in interpreting the scope of their findings. Let’s think of a study that, due to the practical and ethical concerns mentioned in the first blog post, has to be an observational study. Let’s consider the effect of a United States foreign aid package that was administered to twenty countries and its effect on recipient GDP per capita. This study is clearly not experimental. Assignment of treatment (foreign aid package) is not randomly assigned and there could be all sorts of confounding factors that make treated and non-treated units different. Any difference in outcome between treated and control units may be due to treatment, but it could also be caused by a myriad of observed or unobserved confounding factors. Further, not every country may have even been eligible to receive this foreign aid package in the first place. For example, if this foreign aid package was designed to go to developing countries, nations like Norway or Japan never had a chance of receiving treatment. 

Let’s say that our causal estimate in this example is 7.6%. If we interpreted this effect like we would the with the ATE, we would say “receiving this U.S. foreign aid package leads to a 7.6% increase, on average, in GDP per capita”. So close… but this interpretation is still wrong. We only have to modify it a little bit to make it correct: “receiving this U.S. foreign aid package leads to a 7.6% increase, on average, in GDP per capita *for countries that received this foreign aid package*”. We are not estimating the ATE, so we cannot make population-level claims. In this case, population-level claims would suggest that the estimate applies to all countries. Instead, we are estimating the **average effect of treatment on the treated** (ATT). There are all sorts of reasons why some countries may not have received a U.S. foreign aid package of this variety, so we cannot generalize these findings onto the *whole population*. With the ATT, the counterfactual of interest is “what if a treated unit did not receive treatment?” We compare this counterfactual to the observed outcome, treated units.

You can also estimate the **average effect of treatment on the control** (ATC - or average treatment on the untreated (ATU)) which basically tells you the average effect of treatment on the control/untreated units. Unless you have spillover effects where treatment is influencing the outcome of non-treated units, the ATC should be zero. This is fairly intuitive. If control units are *actually* serving as control units (not receiving treatment) then treatment being administered to treated units should not effect control unit outcomes at all. 

### CATE

CATE refers to the **conditional average treatment effect**. Recall the earlier part of this blog where I said that we do not estimate individual-level effects. This is generally true, but we can take a step back from the average effect of treatment on the population (ATE) or the average of effect of treatment on treated and control groups (ATT and ATC) and look at the average effect of treatment on groups within the study. Estimating CATE is important if we have reasons to believe that the effect of treatment should be different across different types of units. To use a very obvious example from [The Effect](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-TreatmentEffects.html), consider a study on the effect of drug designed to reduce the risk of cervical cancer. Suppose that we decided to include men in this study. Estimating the CATE for different genders will result in very different estimates, primarily because men… don’t get cervical cancer. 

That example is a bit obvious, but there are all sorts of examples out there where researchers may plausibly be interested in the variation of effect across different types of units. Let’s go back to foreign aid and consider the effect of U.S. democracy aid (foreign aid designed to support democratization for recipient countries). We could plausibly theorize a situation where, for recipient countries who are democratic, democracy aid indeed bolsters recipient levels of democracy. In contrast, for recipients who are much less democratic, democracy aid may not improve democracy much at all due to corruption. Therefore, we might observe that, while the CATE for already-democratic countries is positive, we observe an effect size closer to zero (meaning the treatment doesn’t work) for non-democratic countries.

### Other Effects

Obviously, there are more treatment effects than the ones briefly described here, including the local average treatment effect (LATE - aka the complier average causal effect (CACE)… yes there are a lot of terms that have multiple names in this area of study), the intention-to-treat effect (ITT), the average treatment effect in the overlap (ATO), etc. Some of these (maybe all three and more) will be discussed later as they become more pertinent to specific methods. In the meantime, this brief review hopefully introduced some readers to why causal inference is focused on estimating average effects, why the ATE is not applicable in many observational settings, and some of the alternatives to the ATE.

In the next post, we will cover assumptions required for causal inference and strategies researchers have employed when these assumptions are not met.
