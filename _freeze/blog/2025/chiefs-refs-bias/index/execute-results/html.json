This upcoming Super Bowl appearance against the Philadelphia Eagles is a re-match from two years ago, where the Chiefs emerged victorious. If the Chiefs can beat the Eagles again, they will go down in history as the first NFL team to win three consecutive Super Bowls (a \"three-peat\").\n\nDespite this unprecedented greatness, many fans, players, and coaches alike are skeptical. It seems that, week-after-week, a referee call just happens to go in the favor of Kansas City, and sometimes, these calls seem to impact the outcome of the game. This has lead to many fans and members of the NFL to question the integrity of the game.\n\nIn fairness, I don't think that anyone is claiming that the Chiefs are cheating. Instead, the claim is that, for some reason, the NFL wants the Chiefs to do well, so they decide to give Kansas City small nudges here and there that go their way and inflate their probability of success. Primarily, skeptics claim the NFL does this by weaponizing the referee system. \"It seems like the Chiefs get all of the calls\" or \"the calls just all happen to go KC's way\" or \"the refs don't call clear penalties against KC like they do towards other teams\". Is any of this true? Or have your eyes deceived you? I think so! And, if you don't believe me, let's dig into the data!\n\nIn this review, we are going to look at four major claims that people make and we're going to see if the data supports such claims. First, outright, do the refs overall favor the Chiefs above any other team? Second, do the refs help out the Chiefs in \"tight spots\" when it really matters (3rd downs, 4th downs, overtime, etc.). Third, do the refs go out of their way to protect Patrick Mahomes in particular? And, lastly, does the NFL treat the Chiefs differently because of Taylor Swift and her relationship with Travis Kelce? \n\n# Claim 1: Do the Refs Help Out the Chiefs?\n\nLet's start looking into this claim by evaluating penalty yard differentials throughout Mahomes's tenure as KC's starting quarterback. Why penalty yard differential (PYD)? Here is the logic: while some calls may go your way in a given game, some calls will go the *other* way. What we care about is this: which team got helped out by the refs *more*? PYD is a way to evaluate that. If a team has a positive PYD, that means they got more yards awarded to them by the refs than the other team. If there is a negative PYD, the other team got more yards awarded to them from the refs. The larger the PYD, the greater the discrepancy. \n\nNow, in a single game, you might either get unlucky, or your team was just poorly coached in that game and truly deserved all the penalties. That's why we're going to take a look overall, aggregating each game every team played from 2018-2024. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Load Play-by-Play (PBP) Data\npbp_data_2018_2024 <- load_pbp(seasons = 2018:2024)\n\n# Calculate Penalty Yard Differential by Team\npenalty_differential_2018_2024 <- pbp_data_2018_2024 %>%\n  # Only Keep Penalty Plays\n  filter(penalty == 1 & !is.na(penalty_yards)) %>%\n  # Create a Long Form Version with a \"Team\" Column and a Possession/Defense Dummy\n  gather(key = \"side\", value = \"team\", posteam, defteam) %>%\n  mutate(side_dummy = ifelse(side == \"posteam\", \"offense\", \"defense\")) %>%\n  # Modify Penalty Yards So That If the Team Committed the Penalty, It is Negative\n  # For Them and Positive for Their Opponent\n  mutate(\n    penalty_yards_adjusted = case_when(\n      penalty_team == team ~ -penalty_yards, \n      penalty_team != team ~ penalty_yards, \n      TRUE ~ 0\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  # Collapse to the Game Level\n  group_by(game_id, team, season) %>%\n  summarize(\n    penalty_yard_differential = sum(penalty_yards_adjusted, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  ) %>%\n  # Collapse to the Team Level\n  group_by(team) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_penalty_yard_differential = sum(penalty_yard_differential, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  )\n\n# Add Team Logos for Plotting\nteam_logos <- nflfastR::teams_colors_logos %>%\n  select(team_abbr, team_logo_espn)\n\n# Merge Penalty Data with Logos\npenalty_differential_2018_2024 <- penalty_differential_2018_2024 %>%\n  left_join(team_logos, by = c(\"team\" = \"team_abbr\"))\n\n# Create a Diverging Bar Chart\nggplot(penalty_differential_2018_2024, aes(x = reorder(team, total_penalty_yard_differential), y = total_penalty_yard_differential)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", aes(fill = total_penalty_yard_differential)) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", \n             color = \"black\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  geom_image(aes(image = team_logo_espn), size = 0.05) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(\n    low = \"#8b0100\",  \n    high = \"#0f3860\",\n    midpoint = 0\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Penalty Yard Differential\"\n  ) +\n  blog_theme() + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Penalty Yard Differential by Team (2018-2024)](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, that's interesting!

What about the Cinderella story of the Vikings this year? They are nowhere close to anyone else in positive PYD. Or, what about my Dallas Cowboys, who have a near identical PYD to the Chiefs? Is the NFL engaged in a conspiracy to help these teams out too? I don't think so... So, we've seen that the Chiefs have a low PYD overall but had a high one this year.

The Chiefs are pretty consistently *negativley* impacted by the refs. In fact, in their three seasons where they won the Super Bowl (2019, 2022, 2023) they had a *negative* PYD *every season*. If they beat the Eagles next week, it will be their first Super Bowl victory with a positive PYD. As you can see, this is not helping the anti-Chiefs case out so far. But, let's take a deeper look into the context of the penalties themselves. After all, a holding call in the 1st Quarter of the game isn't near as impactful as a holding call on 3rd down in a game-winning drive, right? So, let's see if the refs help the Chiefs out in tight spots.\n\n# Claim 2: Do the Refs Help Out the Chiefs in Tight Spots?\n\nWe'll start by looking at PYD during the 4th Quarter.

This is apparent throughout Mahomes's entire career *and* in the current 2024 NFL season. But what we've looked at so far are team-level stats. Patrick Mahomes is becoming (already is?) the face of the NFL and perhaps the league wants to protect their \"golden boy poster child\".\n\nTo evaluate this, I took a look at roughing the passer and defensive pass interference calls. If the refs wanted to protect Mahomes, surely Mahomes would have a higher rate of roughing the passer calls go in his favor. In addition, if the league wanted to help out the Chiefs, surely pass attempts by Mahomes would result in a higher rate of \"fluke\" defensive pass interference calls being made. Below, I plot the average number of roughing the passer calls (standardized by quarterback drop-backs) and the average number of defensive pass interference calls (standardized by passing attempts) over the 2018-2024 seasons. In particular, I compare Mahomes to some of his contemporaries who never seem to get heat for calls going their way...\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nqb_data <- pbp_data_2018_2024 %>%\n  filter(passer %in% c(\"P.Mahomes\", \"J.Allen\", \"L.Jackson\", \"J.Burrow\")) %>%\n  group_by(passer, season) %>%\n  summarize(\n    drop_backs = sum(qb_dropback, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pass_attempts = sum(pass_attempt, na.rm = TRUE),\n    roughing_calls = sum(penalty == 1 & penalty_type == \"Roughing the Passer\", na.rm = TRUE),\n    dpi_calls = sum(penalty == 1 & penalty_type == \"Defensive Pass Interference\", na.rm = TRUE),\n    rc_per_db = (roughing_calls / drop_backs),\n    dpi_per_pa = (dpi_calls / pass_attempts)\n  ) %>%\n  filter(drop_backs >= 100) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\nleague_avg <- pbp_data_2018_2024 %>%\n  group_by(passer, season) %>%\n  summarize(\n    drop_backs = sum(qb_dropback, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pass_attempts = sum(pass_attempt, na.rm = TRUE),\n    roughing_calls = sum(penalty == 1 & penalty_type == \"Roughing the Passer\", na.rm = TRUE),\n    dpi_calls = sum(penalty == 1 & penalty_type == \"Defensive Pass Interference\", na.rm = TRUE),\n    rc_per_db = (roughing_calls / drop_backs),\n    dpi_per_pa = (dpi_calls / pass_attempts)\n  ) %>%\n  filter(drop_backs >= 100) %>%\n  group_by(season) %>%\n  summarise(rc_per_db = mean(rc_per_db),\n            dpi_per_pa = mean(dpi_per_pa)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(passer = \"Average\")\n\n# Merge These Data Sources Together\nqb_data <- qb_data %>%\n  full_join(league_avg, by = c(\"passer\", \"season\", \"rc_per_db\", \"dpi_per_pa\")) %>%\n  # Create a Team to Player Logo\n  mutate(team_logo_espn = case_when(\n      passer == \"P.Mahomes\" ~ \"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/kc.png\",\n      passer == \"J.Allen\" ~ \"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/buf.png\",\n      passer == \"L.Jackson\" ~ \"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/bal.png\",\n      passer == \"J.Burrow\" ~ \"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/cin.png\",\n      TRUE ~ NA\n  ))\n\nggplot(qb_data, aes(x = season, y = rc_per_db)) +\n  # Plot League Average\n  geom_line(\n    data = league_avg,\n    color = \"grey\",  \n    linetype = \"dashed\",  \n    linewidth = 1\n  ) +\n  geom_point(data = league_avg, size = 3, color = \"grey\") + \n  # Plot Mahomes Line\n  geom_line(\n    data = qb_data %>% filter(passer == \"P.Mahomes\"),\n    color = \"#E31837\",\n    linewidth = 1 \n  ) +\n  # Plot Allen Line\n  geom_line(\n    data = qb_data %>% filter(passer == \"J.Allen\"), \n    color = \"#00338D\",\n    linewidth = 1 \n  ) +\n  # Plot Jackson Line\n  geom_line(\n    data = qb_data %>% filter(passer == \"L.Jackson\"),\n    color = \"#9E7C0C\",\n    linewidth = 1 \n  ) +\n   # Plot Burrow Line\n  geom_line(\n    data = qb_data %>% filter(passer == \"J.Burrow\"),\n    color = \"#fb4f14\",\n    linewidth = 1 \n  ) +\n  geom_image(aes(image = team_logo_espn), size = 0.07) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Roughing Calls per QB Drop Backs\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2018, 2024, by = 1)) +\n  blog_theme() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\")  \n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Roughing the Passer Calls per Drop Backs](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Mahomes goes above and below the average for roughing the passer calls per drop-backs.

Then, I looked at the PYD for each game that Swift attended and the PYD when Swift was not in attendance. You can see this information in the plot below.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Load Play-by-Play (PBP) Data\npbp_data_2023_2024 <- load_pbp(seasons = 2023:2024)\n\npenalty_differential_by_game <- pbp_data_2023_2024 %>%\n  # Only Keep Penalty Plays\n  filter(penalty == 1 & !is.na(penalty_yards)) %>%\n  # Create a Long Form Version with a \"Team\" Column and a Possession/Defense Dummy\n  gather(key = \"side\", value = \"team\", posteam, defteam) %>%\n  mutate(side_dummy = ifelse(side == \"posteam\", \"offense\", \"defense\")) %>%\n  # Modify Penalty Yards So That If the Team Comitted the Penalty, It is Negative\n  # For Them and Positive for Their Opponent\n  mutate(\n    penalty_yards_adjusted = case_when(\n      penalty_team == team ~ -penalty_yards, \n      penalty_team != team ~ penalty_yards, \n      TRUE ~ 0\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  # Collapse to the Game Level\n  group_by(game_id, team, season) %>%\n  summarize(\n    penalty_yard_differential = sum(penalty_yards_adjusted, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  ) %>%\n  left_join(team_logos, by = c(\"team\" = \"team_abbr\")) %>%\n  filter(team == \"KC\") %>%\n  mutate(tay_tay = case_when(\n    game_id == \"2024_21_BUF_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2024_20_HOU_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2024_16_HOU_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2024_13_LV_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2024_10_DEN_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2024_09_TB_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2024_05_NO_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2024_02_CIN_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2024_01_BAL_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2023_22_SF_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2023_21_KC_BAL\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2023_20_KC_BUF\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2023_19_MIA_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2023_17_CIN_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2023_16_LV_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2023_15_KC_NE\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2023_14_BUF_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2023_13_KC_GB\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2023_07_LAC_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2023_06_DEN_KC\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2023_04_KC_NYJ\" ~ 1,\n    game_id == \"2023_03_CHI_KC\" ~ 1,\n    TRUE ~ 0\n  )) %>%\n  mutate(game_id = factor(game_id, levels = game_id),\n         game_number = row_number())\n\navg_differential <- penalty_differential_by_game %>%\n  group_by(tay_tay) %>%\n  summarize(avg_penalty_yard_differential = mean(penalty_yard_differential))\n\nggplot(penalty_differential_by_game, aes(x = game_id, y = penalty_yard_differential)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"black\", linewidth = 1.2) + \n  geom_hline(\n    data = avg_differential,\n    aes(yintercept = avg_penalty_yard_differential, color = factor(tay_tay)),\n    linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1, show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = 1), color = \"gray70\", linewidth = 1) + \n  geom_point(aes(color = factor(tay_tay)), size = 3.5) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"\",\n    subtitle = \"Horizontal dashed lines indicate averages when Taylor Swift is & is not present.\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Penalty Yard Differential\",\n    color = \"Was Taylor Swift At This Game?\" \n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"1\" = \"#8b0100\", \"0\" = \"#0f3860\"), \n    labels = c(\"Yes\", \"No\"), \n    breaks = c(\"1\", \"0\"),\n    guide = guide_legend(title.position = \"top\")\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-80, 80, by = 20)) +\n  blog_theme() + \n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.text.align = 0.5\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Taylor Swift Attendance and Penalty Yard Differential (2023-2024)](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe colored horizontal lines reflect the average PYD when Taylor Swift is present (red) and when she is not present (blue). This is kind of fun, because you do see a difference and it isn't entirely negligible. It's a roughly 40-yard difference which means that, on average throughout the entirety of the 2023-2024 NFL season, the Chiefs got 40 more yards from penalties than their opponents did. \n\nIs this evidence that, even if the NFL doesn't rig games for the Chiefs, they are at least more trigger happy to help the Chiefs when Taylor is in attendance? Who knows? I would say that the difference  in PYD is certainly interesting, but it's impossible to know unless you adjust for other factors (I have a whole [blog post](https://brian-lookabaugh.github.io/website-brianlookabaugh/blog/2024/causal-inference-simulation/) about this.)\n\n# Why You Think the Game is Rigged\n\nOverall, the overwhelming evidence suggests that the Chiefs are not being helped by the refs. In many cases, they rank very poorly in PYD, in some cases, they are right in the middle and, in a minority of cases, they are near the top in PYD. Further, plenty of other teams consistently record a larger PYD than the Chiefs (such as the Bills), but we fail to hear about any conspiracy regarding these teams. Why? Why might you think the league helps out the Chiefs when the data suggests otherwise?\n\nThis likely just has to do with both **selection** and **confirmation** bias. If you watch a disproportionately higher number of Chiefs games (which, you likely do because they are on prime-time more often), then you *see* more questionable ref calls being made. As you watch more games over time, you might begin to think that the Chiefs sure do get a lot of calls. However, by *not watching* other teams as often as the Chiefs, you are cognitively discounting how many other questionable calls are made in the favor of other teams. In other words, the pattern only seems suspicious because you're not *seeing* how often these calls are made for other teams.\n\nThis leads to the second problem, which is confirmation bias. Once you have made the (false) connection that all the calls go the Chiefs' way, every additional questionable call you see favor the Chiefs only goes to *confirm* your suspicions. Looking at the game like this makes you susceptible to arriving at false conclusions. You become so focused on the Chiefs, that you fail to see when other teams get away with missed calls or have their opponents called more often or have questionable calls go their way. \n\nSo, what can you take from this? I would say, *stop complaining* (because there is no reason to) and enjoy history being made! This team has been a blast to watch and, as a Dallas Cowboys fan and a resident of the greater Tyler, Texas area (where Mahomes grew up), I sincerely hope that the Chiefs do what they do best and send Philly to Cancun.\n",
