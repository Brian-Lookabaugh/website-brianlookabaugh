The United Nation's (UN) pacifying role in the world has been stained in the public eye with images of Rwanda and Srebrenica, Bosnia coming to mind. Despite this, most studies evaluating the potentially pacifying effects of UN peacekeeping operations (PKOs) have largely demonstrated a positive relationship between UN PKOs and peace. To a lesser extent, researchers have also sought to evaluate the economic consequences of UN PKOs. Given the relationship between economic development and conflict (poorer countries are much more likely to experience civil war than comparatively wealthier countries), UN PKOs should also lead to better economic conditions if we expect PKOs to be effective at promoting peace. 

However, most studies in this area are limited to correlative analyses. At best, these studies can only tell us, "UN PKOs are *associated* with increased levels of peace or development". Where quasi-experimental methods are employed in these literatures to estimate a causal effect, they are often lacking, missing a clear confounder identification strategy, misusing quasi-experimental methods, and/or omitting sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of unobserved confounders. This project employs matching and inverse probability weighting (IPW) designed for panel data as implemented by [@imaiMatchingMethodsCausal2021] to evaluate the causal impact of UN PKOs on economic development. In addition, this project likewise intends to correct for some of the bad habits oftentimes practiced in these literatures.

The remainder of this project is structured as follows. First, I briefly discuss the theoretical relationship between UN PKOs and development to provide the reader with basic familiarity concerning the alleged relationship between treatment (PKO) and outcome (economic development). Second, I provide context and justification concerning the implementation of the novel panel data matching analysis as proposed by @imaiMatchingMethodsCausal2021 and other often-neglected practices. Third, I walk through the data collection and manipulation process, detailing which variables were selected, why they were selected, and how data was manipulated. Fourth, I finally get to the fun part... the results. In this section, I walk readers through the results and their substantive importance. Finally, I conclude with a recap of the project, its limitations, and conclusions generated from the findings.

# PKOs and Economic Development

Many scholars have documented the phenomena of “peacekeeping economies”, where higher levels of economic activity in a host country are directly attributed to the deployment of an international peacekeeping force [@jenningsLifePeacekeptCity2015, @rolandsenSmallFarPeacekeeping2015, @jenningsTransactionsInteractionsEveryday2015, @jenningsPeacekeepingEnterpriseTransaction2018]. Following a PKO deployment, there are numerous channels through which a PKO may contribute to economic growth and development. PKOs can assist in the peace agreement process and police and monitor armed and criminal actors in the post-conflict environment, leading to a safer environment in which economic activity can increase. Emboldened by the stabilizing environment partially produced by a foreign force, individuals can feel physically safer in public to purchase and sell goods and services. Further, a consistently stabler environment may also incentivize increased business activity as the rule of law and property protection is fostered. Additionally, the presence of a large foreign force artificially stimulates demand for a variety of goods and services such as housing, food, transportation, retail, housework, etc. PKOs can assist in the development of civil infrastructure projects such as schools and hospitals and can directly or indirectly (through INGOs) provide immediate relief through humanitarian aid. Local individuals can be impacted by PKOs through direct vocational opportunities provided by a PKO itself.

Alternatively, it may also be the case that the alleged economic benefits of peacekeeping economies are not sustainable and are PKO-dependent. For example, when a PKO withdraws, the artificial demand for a variety of goods and services from the PKO personnel subsequently go away. If the core issues of the prior conflict were not resolved and an enduring peace was not established, the stabilization that fostered economic activity provided by a PKO may likewise erode following a PKO withdrawal. 

Despite sound theoretical reasoning for a causal effect of UN PKO deployments and withdrawals on economic development, prior quasi-experimental evidence of such effects are mixed [@boveEconomicDevelopmentPeacekeeping2017, @carusoEconomicImpactPeacekeeping2017, @beberPromisePerilPeacekeeping2019, @mvukiyehePeacekeepingDevelopmentFragile2020, @bovePeacekeepingHouseholdsWell2021]. This lack of consensus justifies further research in this already-small literature.
