    "text": "My current work is focused on making causal inferences from conflict management programs. Cutting out the jargon, I am curious if policies such as peacekeeping operations, peace agreements, mediation, foreign aid, and foreign direct investment actually contribute to resolving civil conflicts and creating peaceful post-conflict environments. Detailed explanations and technical information concerning this research can be located on the projects section of this site or my Github profile. In addition, I occasionally write blog posts where I primarily discuss topics related to causal inference and data science. In particular, I am working on a comprehensive set of blog posts designed to introduce curious social scientists to causal inference and experimental/quasi-experimental design."
