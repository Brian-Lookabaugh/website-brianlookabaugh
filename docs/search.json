    "text": "My current work is focused on making causal inferences from institutional programs. Cutting out the jargon, I am interested in answering questions that sound like, “does this work?”, “what caused this to happen?” or “what are the consequences of this?”. Detailed explanations and technical information concerning my past work in answering questions such as these can be located on the research section of this site or my Github profile. In addition, I occasionally write blog posts where I primarily discuss topics related to causal inference and data science. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments!"

    "text": "My personal research covers the intersection of program evaluation and peacebuilding. In particular, this involves designing experiments and quasi-experiments to evaluate the impact of various policies designed to promote peace in the world and manage ongoing conflict. I also have an interest in broader statistical methodology and I enjoy researching topics in observational causal inference, Bayesian statistics, machine learning, survival analysis, and multilevel modeling."
