Greetings and welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD Candidate in the Political Science Department at the University of North Texas. Over the past five years, I have leveraged data and statistics to produce quantitative social science research in both independent and collaborative settings. My skill set covers a wide range of topics in data analysis including the process of research design, data manipulation, data visualization, statistical modeling, experimental design, and causal inference.

:::a
My current work is focused on making causal inferences from institutional programs. Cutting out the jargon, I am interested in answering questions that sound like, "does this work?", "what caused this to happen?" or "what are the consequences of this?". Detailed explanations and technical information concerning my past work in answering questions such as these can be located on the [research](research/index.qmd) section of this site or my [Github](https://github.com/Brian-Lookabaugh) profile. In addition, I occasionally write [blog posts](blog/index.qmd) where I primarily discuss topics related to causal inference and data science. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments!
