Greetings and welcome to my personal website! My name is Brian Lookabaugh, and I’m a data scientist working in the federal contracting industry, where I conduct quantitative research covering causal inference, survey analysis, and natural language processing.

My core passion lies in causal analysis but I’m also deeply interested in a wide range of data science disciplines, including Bayesian statistics, experimental design, machine learning, survival analysis, and decision science.

Please feel free to check out my blog where I explore all sorts of quantitative topics and break down what I learn in an accessible, intuitive way. My goal is to make complex ideas in data science both understandable and engaging.
