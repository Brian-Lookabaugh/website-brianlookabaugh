Greetings and welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD Candidate in the Political Science Department at the University of North Texas. Over the past five years, I have leveraged data and statistics to produce quantitative social science research in both independent and collaborative settings. My strongest skills include causal inference (primarily quasi-experimental design), research design, and advanced data manipulation/visualization using R.

My current work is focused on making causal inferences from conflict management programs. Cutting out the jargon, I am curious if policies such as peacekeeping operations, peace agreements, mediation, foreign aid, and foreign direct investment *actually contribute* to resolving civil conflicts and creating peaceful post-conflict environments. Detailed explanations and technical information concerning this research can be located on the [projects](Projects/index.qmd) section of this site or my [Github](https://github.com/Brian-Lookabaugh) profile. In addition, I occasionally write [blog posts](Blog/index.qmd) where I primarily discuss topics related to causal inference and data science. In particular, I am working on a comprehensive set of blog posts designed to introduce curious social scientists to causal inference and experimental/quasi-experimental design.
