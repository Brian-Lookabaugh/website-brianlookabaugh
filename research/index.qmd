My personal research covers the intersection of program evaluation and peacebuilding. In particular, this involves designing experiments and quasi-experiments to evaluate the impact of various policies designed to promote peace in the world and manage ongoing conflict. I also have an interest in broader statistical methodology and I enjoy researching topics in observational causal inference, Bayesian statistics, machine learning, survival analysis, and multilevel modeling.
